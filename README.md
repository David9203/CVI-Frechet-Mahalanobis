# CVI-Frechet-Mahalanobis

Another Indices Test:

	Indices.zip --> recopiled CVI from different frameworks in different languajes (Python, R, Matlab)
	Test_another_indices.ipynb --> Uses mdcgenpy and ClusterFeatures to test different indices in diferents databases
    SyntheticData Configuration---> Containt different Test configuration (normal, triangular, Gamma, Logistic) for data generation

Proposal

	Frechet-Maha-index.py --> Index code
	test_Toydatasets.ipynb ---> test of the index in toys datasets
	
Results-> You can find the Methodology results in csv format

Data

PAM data is presented in the PAM_Data.csv file

On websites https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php and https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data/ you will find the other real-word datasets we work with to run the benchmark datasets
