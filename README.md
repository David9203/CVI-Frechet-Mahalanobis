Datasets:
	Here you can find the used Datasets

Proposal
	Here you can find the tests and codes of the article: Uncertainty clustering internal validity assessment using Fréchet distance for unsupervised learning (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2023.106635)

	Another Indices Test:

		Indices.zip --> recompiled CVI from different frameworks in different languages (Python, R, Matlab)
		Test_another_indices.ipynb --> Uses mdcgenpy and ClusterFeatures to test different indices in different databases
		SyntheticData Configuration---> Containt different Test configurations (normal, triangular, Gamma, Logistic) for data generation

	Test parallelization 
		Code for test parallelization of synthetic data


	Frechet-Maha-index.py --> Index code
	test_Toydatasets.ipynb ---> test of the index in toys datasets
	Timesseries.ipynb ------> UF Test in time series data
	
Results-> You can find the Methodology results in CSV format
