Datasets:
	Here you can find the used Datasets

Proposal
	Here you can find the tests and codes of the article : Uncertainty clustering internal validity assessment using Fréchet distance for unsupervised learning (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2023.106635)

	Another Indices Test:

		Indices.zip --> recopiled CVI from different frameworks in different languajes (Python, R, Matlab)
		Test_another_indices.ipynb --> Uses mdcgenpy and ClusterFeatures to test different indices in diferents databases
		SyntheticData Configuration---> Containt different Test configuration (normal, triangular, Gamma, Logistic) for data generation

	Test parallelization 
		Code for test paralellization of syntethic data


	Frechet-Maha-index.py --> Index code
	test_Toydatasets.ipynb ---> test of the index in toys datasets
	Timesseries.ipynb ------> UF Test in time series data
	
Results-> You can find the Methodology results in csv format
